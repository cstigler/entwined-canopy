        <h1>Come Back at Night!</h1>
        <p>This is Entwined Meadow, an art installation by Charles Gadeken. At night, these trees and shrubs glow with beautiful and ever-changing light patterns until 9:30pm.</p>
        <p>When the lights are on, you can scan this QR code to modify the patterns on this shrub. Come back tonight to engage with Entwined!</p>

        <h1>Entwined Is Off for the Night</h1>
        <p>Entwined turns off at night, but earlier in the evening these trees and shrubs glow with beautiful and ever-changing light patterns.</p>
        <p>When the lights are on, you can scan this QR code to modify the patterns on this shrub. Come back tomorrow night to engage with Entwined!</p>

    <div v-else>
        <h1>Unknown Error</h1>
        <p>Something went wrong with Entwined's interactive controller, but we're not sure what. Sorry about that!</p>
        <p>Try scanning the QR code again. If that doesn't fix it, try again in a few minutes.</p>
